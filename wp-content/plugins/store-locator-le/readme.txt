You can also view the [Product Documentation](https://docs.storelocatorplus.com/) for more information.

= Special Requests =

I accept feature requests for all plugins. The most requested features will make it into the next version if time permits.

If you need something NOW, or are looking for something beyond a basic "tweak" of the plugin, please check out the
[Customization Service](https://www.storelocatorplus.com/product/customization/).

= Upgrades and Patches =

The main product will always remain fully functional and free.  The product is tested with each new WordPress release and updated as required.

If you'd like to have some of the latest "bells & whistles" [purchasing add-ons](https://www.storelocatorplus.com/) is a great way to help support product development.

= My Philosophy =

I strive to create code that runs efficiently and without bugs. Well-written plugins are few and far between. While there are plenty of plugins that look nice, many of those plugins, including the "cool shiny ones" have hidden problems. Over 90% of the plugins available on the WordPress plugin directory generate dozens, if not hundreds, of warnings and errors when you turn off the "hide all the problems" settings.

These hidden problems impact memory usage, fill up disk space, and reduce performance. While you may not see the errors on your WordPress site, they are still being tracked. The more errors, the more disk I/O, the slower the app.

During my 20 years of software development, I have found that leaving "innocuous" warnings in place tends to lead to trouble further down the road. Warnings today often become errors tomorrow. Many programming languages, PHP included, continue to tighten security and close loopholes that are typically found living near warning messages. Some warnings are telling you to "change this now, it will be gone tomorrow". Eventually tomorrow will come.

While my plugins may not be the prettiest on the block, I do try to make sure that all the hidden stuff you don't see is designed as well as it can be. My code is not perfect, but when I find a bug I try to fix it fast.  If I create a bug I try to fix it even faster.

I like to write plugins that last. I hope you appreciate my work.

= Rate This Plugin =

Please [rate this plugin](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/store-locator-le/)!
Rating the plugin, hopefully with 5 stars, helps increase the exposure on WordPress, which generates more downloads and purchases of add-ons.
The more add-ons I sell the easier it is to put food on the table and give me more time to code cool new features.

Give us a chance to address your concerns if this plugin doesn't earn 5 stars by [contacting us](https://www.storelocatorplus.com/mindset/contact-us/) directly or by posting in the [support forum](https://www.storelocatorplus.com/forums/) at the website.

= How do I report a bug? =

Post in the [support forum](https://www.storelocatorplus.com/forums/).
You can also [contact us](https://www.storelocatorplus.com/mindset/contact-us/) via email.

= What are the Add Ons? =

Add ons extend the functionality of the plugin beyond the basic service and features and can be purchased ala-carte.
This gives those customers who want more out of the plugin the extra features they desire while keeping the main plugin as
efficient as possible for everyone else.   It also provides a great way to support future development while getting a
"little something extra" when contributing to the development of the product.

All plugins are true add-on packs.  They are non-destructive OPTIONAL additions to the base plugin.
They do not require the base plugin to be uninstalled or re-installed.
Installing an add-on pack will not change location data or modify base plugin settings.


= What are the terms of the license? =

The license is GPL. Learn more on the [License Terms page](https://www.storelocatorplus.com/products/general-eula/).

= How can I translate the plugin into my language? =

Store Locator Plus is now part of the WordPress Translate system.

You can translate this readme file and the text strings in the main Store Locator Plus plugin at [Translate.WordPress.Org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/store-locator-le).
